<center><h2>Welcome to Guerrilla Warfare, this is where you will learn how Guerrilla Warfare helps in battlling enemies without getting involve in a big conflict between us and them. It is a tactic they use which involves ambushing, hit and run, and sabotages. Our leader Che Guevara was trained in the Guerrilla military in Mexico City and then was trained enough to become a Guerrilla soldier. We fight in our own military army that isn't part of any government. We use Guerrilla force to attack the Batista army in small segments, some days we plan, others we attack. We split our army into many groups so they each can do their part in fulfilling our accomplishments which is to take out the Batista army and over throw Fulgencio Batista from power. Our Guerrilla army is well trained and is diciplin under one purpose to fulfill and we will stop at nothing to get our victory. Will you join the Guerrilla forces, will you fight for communism and a revolution, will you be the hero that will bring prosperity and end of poverty among all of Latin America?</h2></center>
