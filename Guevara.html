<center><h3>Ernesto Guevara was an Argentenian medical student, marxist and guerrilla leader, who is leading the revolution that can change Cuba. He was born in Rosario Argentina, as a child he suffered from asthma which lead his family to move to Buenos Aires, south of Rosario. Ernesto was a smart student who read lots of books and studied important subjects. He took a field trip with his friend Alberto Granados and explored all of South America. He was radicalized by the poverty and in 2 years, alone he went to Guetemala to see the united fruit company, which was the main reason whiched caused poverty. Ernesto thought communism would bring the end to poverty. After the replacement of Jacobo Arbenz, Ernesto escaped Guatemala from all the oppressors of communism and he felt he was not safe. Ernesto left to Mexico City where he met his first wife, Hilda, and Raul and Fidel Castro, who were both in the guerrilla army. Fidel talked to Ernesto into joining his band of Guerrillas to overthrough Fulgencio Batista out of power for he is a capitalist pig who is making poverty of his homeland. Ernesto studied communism with Hilda and Fidel and in due time, trained very well in Guerrilla Warfar. Ernesto was nicknamed "Che" which means guy in Argentenian language, he was known as "guy" Guevara. Che then sailed away with the army to Cuba and began battle. For his bravery and courage for the revolution and desire for communism, lead him to be in 2nd in command of his army. And now we need you to aid him in ending poverty, getting rid of all capitalism and American Currency and make Cuba independent of it state and bring equality, peace and land through out all of Cuba.</h3></center>
