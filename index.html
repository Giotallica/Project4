<center><h3>Welcome to The Communist Guerrilla Forces, this is a page where you will learn about Marxism and Communism. You will also learn who is your leader for the guerrilla army, Che Guevara and how he is a great man and defeated Batista's army who were capitalist pigs who wanted to take land from the civilians of Cuba and the rest of Latin America which caused lots of poverty while they benefited from it. Che fought against it and needs you to join his army to fight them. Will you join the army?</h3></center>
