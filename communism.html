<center><h2>Welcome to the communism page, here this is where you will learn communism, if you want to learn communism and why we are fighting for it, you may continue reading this below</h2></center>
<center><h3>Communism, the idea that came from Karl Marx and Fredrick Engels, both German philosephers who studied the world during the mid 19th century, he wrote ideas and methods of making a pure and stable society. During this time capitalism was the most used political economic party. Used by Great Brittan, America, Austrailia, Irland and Canada, and many more countries. Capitalism was created during the industrial revolution. Its purpose is to let everyone invest their money into businesses and get their money back and it is the best way to run a society. People are to move from farms and work into factories and get paid depending on what they do, while the factory owner makes all the money from all what he produces, it drive money all over the place. Facotory owners sell their products and then the people that bought it are people in the marketing business and they sell their products in stores and get their money from those who work in other jobs too. Money drives the society. But a downfall to this is sometimes rich bussiness owners get corrupt with what they own and they most likely won't share what they have and let people with no money suffer from not being able to pay for food, home and other necessities. During this time in Europe, of the 1900s, many countries were rising with their economic power and were are ready settled with what they own, especially Great Briain. They had a lot of colonies and that caused a lot of tension among other nations. Thus lead to a conflict and tension with each other. Germany wanted more land and so they are at a point of conquering other lands. They were militarising with their army and weapons. So is Russia. All these nations are rising and getting to powerful. Germany made a blank check with Austria-Hungary since they are neighboring nations that they will help them with anything that happens in their situations. Germany during this time had 2 conflicts that they both share the common enemy, Russia and France. Russia assembled an underground alliance with the slavic people of Serbia and Austria-Hungary to revolt against the Austrians for Austria-Hungary is a nation of Austrian,Hungarians and slavic people. They felt that the archduke, Franz Ferdinand was unfair to the slavic people and wouldn't let them get their independence so they plot an assasination. They killed the archduke June 28, 1914 and war broke out among Austria-Hungary and Serbia. They fought and Germany since they vowed to help them with anything joined the war. Russia joined since Germany joined and brought France into it since France had a common enemy with Russia and that was Germany. Germany invaded Belgium trying to get to France which brought Britian to the great war. Thus ww1 happened. During this time in Russia. The proletariat was force to fight in battle while the rich bourgeoisies had fun with all the riches they were getting from the poor. This lead to a revolution and it was to get the Tzar out of power. They overthrew him and then decided to have a new sort of power 2 parties were competing for. The Dumas and the Provisional government. The Duma party are rich people who want rule just like the Tzar power while the provisional government are the party of socialist who wanted to get rid of the tzar, but they are also rich people who wanted power. Then there is the bolshevik party which was lead by Vladmir Lenin,a studier of communism and Karl Marx. He won the population of the people by promising land,peace and food. Everyone went with Lenin's bolshevik party and joined his side. The provisional government didn't want to accept the bolshevik in power so they had a civil war, white provisionals and red the bolsheviks. Leon Trotsky aided the bolsheviks and was the assistant to Lenin while Stalin held the penalties of anti Communist. Finally the bolsheviks won and ordered power, Lenin then became a dictator and got rid of all the anti communist and assembled the soviet of power and that is the origin of the Soviet Union and the mass spreading of communism.</h3></center>
