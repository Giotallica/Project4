<center><h3>Capitalism is the idea of ruling a society by free marketing and competing for business. Like communism, it is an economic and political theory that started in the late 1800s. It was founded in Europe and used by the British, Italians, Germans, French and many others. It is the idea of starting a business and allowing people to work for it and get paid dependning on what they do. It is the opposite of communism. Capitalism is mainly benificial for the bourgeoisie class because all they do is collect the money and give what ever they feel in their heart back to the community. While the working proletariat class have to work and spend only what they have to taxes, food and family. The bourgeoisie also spends that same ampount and then hoards all of the rest and only share among other rich gentlemen. The working class dissagree with capitalism because it isn't equal and fair for them to hoard all the wealth while we live in poor conditions and have barely food left for families. In factories, people are mistreated and are beat up to work, only so that the bourgeoisie can just produce 10 times as fast and collect his earnings 10 times as fast. We don't support capitalism and despise all capitalist nations and people. We don't want your kind here. If your a capitalist, PLEASE LEAVE THIS SITE, if your a communist and socialist or any type that is not capitalist, your welcome to stay.</h3></center>
